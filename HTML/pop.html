                        I used to rule the world<br>
                        Seas would rise when I gave the word<br>
                        Now in the mornin', I sleep alone<br>
                        Sweep the streets I used to own<br>
                        <br>
                        I used to roll the dice<br>
                        Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes<br>
                        Listen as the crowd would sing<br>
                        "Now the old king is dead, long live the king"<br>
                        One minute, I held the key<br>
                        Next, the walls were closed on me<br>
                        And I discovered that my castles stand<br>
                        Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand<br>
                        <br>
                        I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'<br>
                        Roman cavalry choirs are singin'<br>
                        Be my mirror, my sword and shield<br>
                        My missionaries in a foreign field<br>
                        For some reason, I can't explain<br>
                        Once you'd gone, there was never<br>
                        Never an honest word<br>
                        And that was when I ruled the world<br>
                        <br>
                        It was a wicked and wild wind<br>
                        Blew down the doors to let me in<br>
                        Shattered windows and the sound of drums<br>
                        People couldn't believe what I'd become<br>
                        Revolutionaries wait<br>
                        For my head on a silver plate<br>
                        Just a puppet on a lonely string (Mmm, mmm)<br>
                        Aw, who would ever wanna be king?<br>
                        <br>
                        I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'<br>

                        For some reason, I can't explain<br>
                        I know Saint Peter won't call my name<br>
                        Never an honest word<br>
                        But that was when I ruled the world<br>
                        <br>
